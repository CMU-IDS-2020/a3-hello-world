Happiness is an important status for most of us, but it is hard to say what makes people happy. Understanding the factors that bring people happiness is the key to improve people’s happiness level and overall life satisfaction. The general goal of this app is to explore the factors related to people’s happy score on a global basis. Utilizing "The World Happiness Report" dataset, we viualize happiness scores of 155 countries with respect to seven factors from 2015 to 2019. Users can also select to show various types of regression lines on the plot for their reference.


## Project Goals

TODO: **A clear description of the goals of your project.** Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.
 
Happiness is an important status for most of us, but it is hard to say what makes people happy. Understanding the factors that bring people happiness is the key to improve people’s happiness level and overall life satisfaction. The general goal of this app is to explore the factors related to people’s happy score on a global basis. 

The dataset that we have chosen is happiness 2017 dataset, one of Kaggle’s dataset. This dataset gives the happiness rank and happiness score of 155 countries around the world based on seven factors including family, life expectancy, economy, generosity, trust in government, freedom, and dystopia residual. Sum of the value of these seven factors gives us the happiness score and the higher the happiness score, the lower the happiness rank. So, it is evident that the higher value of each of these seven factors means the level of happiness is higher. We can define the meaning of these factors as the extent to which these factors lead to happiness. Dystopia is the opposite of utopia and has the lowest happiness level. Dystopia will be considered as a reference for other countries to show how far they are from being the poorest country regarding happiness level.

There are three parts to my report as follows:

## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?



## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?



**Draft**:

Dataset selection: Kaggle, Assignemnt 2 datasets (n hours)

Data cleaning: (n hours)

Brainsotrming about visualization types:

- Scatter plot for basic attribute correlation
- Spatial visualizaiton: Map
- Changes over time
- ML insights:
  - Predicitons for 2019 V.S. True data in 2019
  - Residual analysis (why some predictions are bad, can be possibly shown by using interactive plot?)
  - \* How the model learns the data? i.e. show the training process?
